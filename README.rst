Overview
========

This is a repository dedicated to my configuration files for Microsoft Window's PowerShell shell environment and other miscellaneous scripts I use on Microsoft Windows.

Installation
============

1. To find the where these files need to be placed, open up PowerShell and view the $PROFILE or $env:Profile variable by typing in $PROFILE and using tab completion. Press enter to view the value of the variable.
2. Make sure the config files match those specified in your $PROFILE variable and place them in the location specified in the $PROFILE variable.

Background
==========

While I am not generally a fan of Microsoft Windows, recent developments have led to a need for me to use Microsoft Window's as a development environment. I figured I'd make the best of the environment and learn to use PowerShell to it's fullest.
